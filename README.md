# TRec's Artifacts

The artifact repository for the paper titled:

> <b>TRec: A Regression Test Recommender for Java Projects</b>  
> _Authors:_ Sai Kiran Bhrugumalla and Ajay Kumar Jha <br>
> _Conference:_ ICSME'24 (Tool Demo Track)

In the paper, we proposed a technique and a tool, TRec, for identifying and recommending tests for code changes in CI environments. 
We evaluated TRec by recommending tests for 1,867 developers' modified methods in 493 commits from three open-source Java projects. 
This artifact repository contains data and tools used in the study.
